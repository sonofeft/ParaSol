"""A setuptools based setup module for ParaSol

See:
http://parasol.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
https://github.com/sonofeft/ParaSol

If installing from source, then
the best way to install ParaSol is to use pip after navigating to the source directory::

    cd <path to where setup.py is located>
    pip install -e .

This will execute the setup.py file and insure that its pip-specific commands are run.
